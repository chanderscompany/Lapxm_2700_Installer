NOTES:
Line 1 = Hardware Address - Usually used to identify a 485 hardware device
Line 2 = Number of Mux Levels - Max mux level that must be read
Line 3 = Number of A2d Channels - Max A2d channel that must be read from all mux levels.
Line 4 = Total number of parameters - This it all parameters including different radar state conditions
Line 5 = Number or unique parameters - This is only Parameters that have unique names
Line 6 - X = Information about each parameter in the following order:

DataType,                // 0 = Integer, 1 = Float, 2 = Bit, 3 = Communication failure flag, 4 = Log Power Formula
                         // Log Power Formula = ( ( FloatValue * Scale) * (FloatValue * Scale) ) * Bias

Line X = 'EndOfFile' - This tells the reader not to read any further.

// The Radar State bit pattern is defined as
XXXXXXXX | XXXXXXXX | BBBBBBBB | RTxxxOOO

X - Unused
B - Bits for beam direction (256 possible)
O - Operational Status      (64 possible) (0 = Unloaded, 1 = Loaded, 2 = Running, 3 = Paused, 4 = Stopped)
R - RASS ON/OFF state       (2 possible)  (0 = Off, 1 = On)
